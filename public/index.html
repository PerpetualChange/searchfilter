    <title>Search Engine Filter</title>
    <meta name="description" content="SearchEngineFilter.com lets you specify specific sites that you would like to include or
      exclude from your search results. If you enter sites to include, only results from those
      sites will be returned in your search. If you enter sites to exclude, the search will
      drop those sites from the search results. Currently the search only works on Google.
      Other search engines will be added at a future date, as well as the ability to save
      your Favorites to a database. Currently the Favorites will persist only as long as
      you keep your browser page open.">
